# CompuTec Gateway - Printer

CompuTec Labels has definition of printers where you can define printers and link them to psychical printers, to get print out. If printer is accessible from the machine where you installed CompuTec Label Manager on, you can configure printers as defined [here](setup/configuration/general-configuration#printers).

If you need to get print out from printer which CompuTec Labels Application Server doesn't have access to, you can use CompuTec Gateway Application.
